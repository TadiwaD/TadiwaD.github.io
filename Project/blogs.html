            <article>
                <h3>How to Care for Your Streetwear Clothes</h3>
                <p> 1. Follow the Care Labels Always check the care labels on your garments for specific washing instructions. Each piece may have unique requirements depending on the fabric and design, so this is crucial for long-term care.</p>

<p> 2. Wash in Cold Water Cold water is gentler on fabrics and prevents shrinking, fading, and damaging any prints or designs. This keeps your streetwear looking fresh. </p>

<p>3. Turn Clothes Inside Out Turning your clothes inside out before washing protects prints, logos, and embroidered designs from friction and wear during the wash cycle. </p>

<p> 4. Air Dry or Use Low Heat Avoid using high heat in dryers, as it can shrink fabrics and damage graphics. Air drying is best, or if necessary, use the lowest heat setting in your dryer. </p>

<p> 5. Use Gentle Detergents Harsh detergents can break down fabrics and cause prints to crack or colors to fade. Always use mild, gentle detergents to preserve the quality of your streetwear.</p>
